-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_- Installing Mario 3 -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_- 

Unzip all of the contents into your default Jazz2 folder. The tilesets should
appear in 1.23's or 1.24's Jazz Creation Station when opened. If not, then
whee argh you did something wrong.

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_- Mario 3 Tileset Credits -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_- 

These tileset are near perfect replicas of the Super Nintendo game Super Mario
Brothers 3. I compiled tiles from every single level in the entire game into
970 tiles and then made a day and a night version. 95% of those tiles I did
not create myself but got from the game one by one. So while I did compile the
set and go through the entirety of the game this is still just a very large
done by hand conversion. I am the only one who did any of this and fish is good.

This tileset is part of the Jazz 2 Level Creators (j2lc) collective. You will be
part of the collective too, little one.

I made this entire thing in a good two weeks and put a lot of hours into it. I
hope you will enjoy it, and perhaps even the CTF levels I threw together quickly.

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_- General Information Crap -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_- 

First off, I can be contacted via e-mail at: jzinx@juno.com

Secondly, the only major differences between the day and night tilesets are the
background textures and the overall darkness. Strangely enough, the night version
is darker. Crazy how that works.

The CTF levels have almost no differences save a couple minor things (the background
eyecandy, for one, and the tileset itself for another).

Using the tilesets should not be difficult but there are a few parts of the set
you should pay close attention to the masking of. These parts were masked oddly
to retain a peice of realism for how the actual SMB3 game is designed to play.

It would be appreciated if you would give me credit if you use either of these
sets or throw the CTF levels into a pack or something. KTHX.
