- Method for multi language - 

This program supported the multi language mode. (Ver2.22)
We wish to express our gratitude to Chinese hacker and the American hacker. ;)
I did not make it if there was no assistance of them. 

*Use
1."multilanguage - (COUNTRY) - language.ini" is copied
  onto the same folder as emuhaste.exe.
2.Execute the emuhaste.exe
3.Let's enjoy!

However, I do not understand Chinese. 
"language.ini" that I can make is only an English version. 
Please make language.ini from you.

*Make
1.Open the "language.ini" to text editor.
2.Please correct the system message.
3.Please make [COUNTRY = "(ENG)"] your name of a country by three characters. 
 (example : Japan=(JPN) China=(CHN) Korea=(KOR) France=(FRA) etc..)
4.Up-load it. :)

The contact to me is unnecessary. 
Please distribute it again freely.
